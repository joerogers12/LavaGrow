This document serves as a brainstorming space for the architectural and programmatic structure of the system 

Seeding Planner

- The platform will ideally be on tablets and mobile devices for input in the field and computers for larger planning view and efficient input
- Taking this one step at a time, the first iteration of the software will be created for a web app
- React seems to be the best choice for future scalability and integration with mobile devices

Phase 1:
- Planning: Set up the documentation as a project with proper phases including requirements/functionality identification
	- Then schedule and start coding
- Learn the basics of React to begin the project
	- Finish fellowship over winter break (Dec 24)
- Create a grid view of some type for planning crops
	- Work on this over winter break into next quarter (Dec 24 - Feb 25)
- Create a recordkeeping database
	- Maybe this should use something like sql in the backend??
	- Can do this while in data management class (Jan - March 25)
