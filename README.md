Track, manage, and plan the growth of your crops

LavaGrow was built out of the desire for an efficient and effective way for small farms to manage the production of their land. 

While I was growing fruits and vegetables at a small farm, I noticed there was a slight lack of data collection management as all of the output numbers from our fields were being written by hand on paper. After the harvest data were recorded, they would be stored away for basic recordkeeping purposes. This worked well as it was but I envisioned a process of heavily analyzing the input and output numbers to optimize our production. 

I had next to no experience creating software so I began creating spreadsheets to store the data. These sheets allowed us to track many metrics from seed germination rate to the pounds of turmeric we pulled from each foot of garden bed. Knowing these numbers can be invaluable to the livelihood of farmers by allowing them to focus on what works and shift their strategies to accommodate growing conditions.  

The problem with the spreadsheets is it required very precise input from users and on the farm there were several users and varying levels of data input interest. This lead to a mess of values in the sheets and a lot of necessary upkeep. Additionally, any time slight changes needed to be made like adding a crop name or parameter, there would need to be someone who knew how to do it. In the end, the spreadsheet method was not sustainable and after I left the farm it soon fell apart.

I knew there must be a way to make the recordkeeping experience simple and effective for farms like this one. Now that I am studying software engineering in school, I am returning to this idea to create a product that will accomplish my original goal.

Stay tuned for updates!
